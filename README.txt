This is a tutorial for Playful. Playful is a behavior orchestration software for robotics.
It is meant for professional roboticists who want to acquire the skill to develop reactive complex behavior.

Playful is a thin layer that can be placed on top over any Python robotic API, including ROS and NaoQi.
