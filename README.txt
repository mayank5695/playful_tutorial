This is a tutorial for Playful.
For more information on Playful, and download of the executable: playful.is.tuebingen.mpg.de
Currently, Playful supports exclusively Ubuntu (any recent version)

This tutorial is a replacement for the documentation (sort of). We find tutorials, i.e. examples that
users can run, less ambiguous.

This tutorial assumes you read the scientific paper published in IEEE Robotics and Automation Magazine. This paper gives all the required
background to understand the scripts used as example in this tutorial. You can find a link to this paper: playful.is.tuebingen.mpg.de

The tutorial consists of 10 "subtutorials", enumerated from tutorial1 to tutorial10. To each corresponds a playful script that can be run:

how-to run one of the tutorial
------------------------------

1. download playful executable from playful.is.tuebingen.mpg.de.
2. make the downloaded file executable (in a terminal: 'chmod +x playful') 
2. the executable does not need installation. Put this file anywhere in the path.
   ( $PATH environment variable, see https://askubuntu.com/questions/60218/how-to-add-a-directory-to-the-path
                                or https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EnvironmentVariables#Persistent_environment_variables )
3. in a terminal: go to any of the tutorial folder (e.g.: 'cd <>/playful_tutorial/tutorial8')
4. int the termina: run the executable passing "execute" as parameter ('playful execute'). Press 'q' to exit


how to go through all tutorials
-------------------------------

1. go the directory 'tutorial1'
2. read the README.txt file there
3. this file will redirect you to another file with more info, which will redirect you to another file with more info, etc
4. it will take you around 1 hour


what is needed for the executable to run ?
------------------------------------------

1. Ubuntu
2. Any (relatively) recent Python 2.7 should be installed as default Python interpreter. (Python 3 will not work).
   (this is default on any version of ubuntu)
