# In this (almost) final tutorial, our virtual robot chases balls.
# It always go toward the closest ball ("priority of inv_distance")

# While all the node we encountered so far where Python nodes, the node ball_interaction is a collection
# of nodes. It is possible to create behavior trees of arbitrary depth.

# Notice the argument passing to "ball_interaction" ('speed=0.1', line 31). Default value for speed is 0.1, but
# if you change the speed in the program (at line 42), you may notice its value "flows" to parametrize the follow node

# If you fully understand this script, and the related python code, then you understand Playful.

# More explanation regarding the script blow:
# display robot: shows the robot. In real life that would be your robot simulator (typically no such node when using a physical robot)
# virtual_balls_detection: simulates the robot perceiving balls. In real life that would run your vision library
#                          detecting colored balls from camera stream, determining their color and using transforms
#			   to compute their position
# targeting_ball: ball_display: for each ball in the scene, spawn a node that display it. In real life, you would not need this.
# targeting_ball: ball_interaction : for each ball, spawn a robot interactive behavior. The robot can only interact with a single
#                                    ball at a time. "priority of inv_distance" set the robot to interact with the closest

# "ball_interacting" is defined as:
#     smile: set the robot to smile when the targeted ball is close
#     follow : set the robot to go toward the targeted ball
#
# Exercise: uncomment "laugh" in the ball_interaction subtree. Can you guess what this will result in ?


ball_interaction | speed=0.1 :
	smile, while distance < 3, priority of 2
	#laugh, while distance < 7, priority of 1
	follow | speed=speed


program:

	virtual_balls_detection
	display_robot
	targeting ball: ball_display
	targeting ball: ball_interaction, priority of inv_distance | base_score=1.0 ; speed=0.1
	stay_put, priority of 1
