# Write any (single word) arbitrary strings here to define a resource.
# Files declaring resources must be called "resources.txt" and be placed
# in a "config" folder which is contained in a folder with a "__playful__"
# empty file in it

# Only the node which had its access to the console resource
# granted will display something in the console.

# when using playful with a robot,
# typical resources that could be
# declared would be "wheels", "left_arm", "head", etc ...
# so that to ensure several leaf nodes do not send commands to
# the same joint at the same time
# "face" resource is used from tutorial 5 and "wheels" from tutorial 8
